IBM Employee attrition Prediction model development and data analysis for enhanced retention strategies

This project comprises three essential deliverables:

Data Preprocessing: the initial task involves preparing and cleaning the HR dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive deep into the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and potential predictors of attrition.
Employee Attrition Prediction Model and Recommendations: Build predictive models to forecast employee attrition, evaluate their performance, and select the best-performing model. Based on model results, provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention and satisfaction.
